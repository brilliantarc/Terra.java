    <title>Brilliant Arc Terra Client API</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    The Terra 2.0 Client API allows developers to build software applications
    locally that can interact with the Brilliant Arc Terra Taxonomy
    Management Tool on an active and ongoing basis, with the same level of
    functionality as the Terra Client UI. This enables local back-office
    and consumer-driven applications to utilitze the knowledge contained
    within Terra as they would any other database, but with the added power
    of the Terra relations and inheritance technologies.
</p>

<p>
    The API is a very lightweight, thin wrapper around the RESTful JSON-based
    server API using the Java.net Jersey client libraries. Most of the business
    logic, authentication, authorization and other functionality resides on the
    server. The client API does contain a few bits of helper code, but it is not
    a full-blown object model system. It is simple, safe, and fast.
</p>

<p>
    The Terra 2.0 Client API has been redesigned to conform with C# coding
    standards. It is also somewhat functional in nature, due to its
    interactions with the server: no objects are ever directly modified
    by the API. For example, updating a category will return a new
    instance of a Category object; it will not change the category object
    submitted.
</p>

<p>
    Functions of the API are all handled on the Client services, rather
    than the objects themselves. This keeps the library both simple and
    thread-safe. For example, when mapping a heading to a category, you
    call a function on Terra.Client.Headings, not on the Terra.Heading
    object. This reinforces the functional nature of the API.
</p>

<p>
    To make a request of the server, first authenticate a user against an
    instance of the Terra.Client, then submit requests across that client's
    services.
</p>
<pre>
    Client.Services terra = client.authenticate("someuser", "somepassword");
    Taxonomy taxonomy = terra.taxonomies().create("FON", "Sample Name", "sample-slug", "en");
    Taxonomy check = terra.taxonomies().get("FON", "sample-slug");
</pre>
<p>
    This API represents the current and complete functionality available to
    the Terra Client Application (UI). As new features are added to that
    application, they will become available in this API as well. In fact,
    the Terra Client UI itself uses the same calls as the API--we are
    "eating our own dog food", as it were.

    <i>This documentation is rather new, and will be updated with additional
    samples and tutorials.</i> In the mean time, the source code and test cases
    are an excellent place to look for examples. The source code is available
    openly on <a href="https://github.com/brilliantarc/Terra.java">GitHub</a>.
