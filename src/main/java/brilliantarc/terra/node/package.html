    Contains the model classes for information stored in the Terra server
    regarding European Directories.  These form a layer on top of the default
    Brilliant Arc concepts like portfolios and memes, so that you can interact
    with the Terra services at a higher, more comfortable level.

<h3>Equality</h3>
<p>
    Memes have their hashCode() and equals() methods fully compliant, so
    comparisons between Meme or Node instances will work as expected.  Most
    memes equate on opco and slug, as well as type.
</p>


<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>
    The toString methods of all the memes in this package will return a detailed
    string describing the features of each meme, including the name, slug,
    external identifier, and so on.  This is useful for debugging, but it is
    not very pretty to display to users.  If you display a value to users, call
    the getName() or getSlug() methods on the meme; don't just rely on toString().
</p>
<p>
    Use this:
</p>
<pre>
      System.out.println("Received " + meme.getName());
</pre>
<p>
    Not this:
</p>
<pre>
    System.out.println("Received" + meme);
</pre>
<p>
    That is, unless you want the "debuggable" output!
